quote : String
quote = "Nobody respects money anymore, neither those who have it nor those " ++
  "who don't.  When asked what they want to be some day, twenty percent of " ++
  "young Germans answer \"artist.\" Work is no longer endured as a given of " ++
  "the human condition. The  accounting departments of corporations confess " ++
  "that they have no idea where value comes from. The market's bad " ++
  "reputation would have done it in a decade ago if not for the bluster and " ++
  "fury, not to mention the deep pockets, of its apologists. It is common " ++
  "sense now to see progress as synonymous with disaster. In the world of " ++
  "the economic, everything is in flight, just like in the USSR under " ++
  "Andropov. Anyone who has spent a little time analyzing the final years " ++
  "of the USSR knows very well that the pleas for goodwill coming from our " ++
  "rulers, all of their fantasies about some future that has disappeared " ++
  "without a trace, all of their professions of faith in \"reforming\" this " ++
  "and that, are just the first fissures in the structure of the wall. The " ++
  "collapse of the socialist bloc was in no way victory of capitalism; it " ++
  "was merely the bankrupting of one of the forms capitalism takes. " ++
  "Besides, the demise of the USSR did not come about because a people " ++
  "revolted, but because the nomenclature was undergoing a process of " ++
  "reconversion. When it proclaimed the end of socialism, a small fraction " ++
  "of the ruling class emancipated itself from the anachronistic duties " ++
  "that still bound it to the people. It took private control of what it " ++
  "already controlled in the name of \"everyone.\" In the factories, the " ++
  "joke went: \"we pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.\" The oligarchy " ++
  "replied, \"there's no point, let's stop pretending!\" They ended up with " ++
  "the raw materials, industrial infrastructures, the military-industrial " ++
  "complex, the banks and the nightclubs. Everyone else got poverty or "++
  "emigration. Just as no one in Andropov's time believed in the USSR, no " ++
  "one in the meeting halls, workshops and offices believes in France " ++
  "today. \"There's no point,\" respond the bosses and political leaders, " ++
  "who no longer even bother to file the edges off the \"iron laws of the " ++
  "economy.\" They strip factories in the middle of the night and announce " ++
  "the shutdown early next morning. They no longer hesitate to send in " ++
  "anti-terrorism units to shut down a strike, like with the ferries and " ++
  "the occupied recycling center in Rennes. The brutal activity of power " ++
  "today consists both in administering this ruin while, at the same time, " ++
  "establishing the framework for a \"new economy.\""
